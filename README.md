# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to provide a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type, analyse the total weekly fares for each city type and visualize these results in a multiple-line graph. The three city types are: Urban, Suburban and Rural, and this analysis will show how the city type impacts revenue levels for drivers and PyBer.

## Results

A preliminary analysis of the PyBer data is summarized in the following table:

### Total Rides, Drivers and Fares
As seen in the table above, the total rides, drivers and fares are highest in urban cities, followed by suburban cities, and lowest in rural areas. This shows that the number of rides, drivers and fares increases in proportion to population size and density of different city types. It stems to reason that in rural areas with lower population densities, people are more likely to have and rely on personal vehicles for mobility, and are less likely to use ride-sharing services like PyBer. However, in more densely populated urban and suburban centers, we see a significant spike in rides, drivers and fare revenues. Therefore, people are more likely to use ride-sharing services out of conveniences such as lower wait times for rides due to the driver density and availability in urban cities.  


### Average Fare per Ride, and per Driver
As seen in the table above, the average fare per ride and per driver is highest in rural areas and lowest is urban centers. This shows that in rural areas the each ride covers a longer distance, whereas short trips are more common in urban centers. Rural PyBer drivers earn more than three times (3x) more for each ride than urban drivers so, and one and a half times (1.5x) more than suburban drivers. In addition, when the average fare per ride is compared with the average fare per driver, we can see that urban drivers earn significantly less than the average fare per ride, whereas suburban and rural drivers earn an average that is significantly more than the the average fare per ride. This shows that lower driver density in the suburban and rural communities results in more rides per driver, whereas the higher driver density in urban centers results in lower rides per driver.

### Total Fare by City Type
![Line Graph of Total Fares (USD) by City Type](https://github.com/nishavenkatesh11/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/PyBer_fare_summary.png)

As seen in the graph above, urban centers see the highest revenue and total weekly fares, followed by suburban communities. Rural communities see the lowest weekly fares. This is likely due to disparity in population desity between urban, suburban and rural areas, which impacts access to personal transportation, and reliance and convenience or ride-sharing services. 

## Summary

The following three business recommendations could aid in addressing disparities among the city types.
* Create an incentive to encourage more urban drivers to provide services within suburban communities. This will shift the average fare per ride to average fare per driver ratio favorably by equalizing this ratio between urban and suburban areas.
* Create a long ride incentive for urban customers, to increase distance per ride, which is favorably increase the average fare per ride. This can be done by various strategies, such as increasing the flat base rate per ride, so that customers see the value in longer rides. 
* Create a driver currency requirement in urban areas. Currenty, there are only enough rides for 67% of the drivers, assuming a unique driver per ride. This means that over 32% of urban drivers are inactive. By implementing a driver currency requirement, PyBer can reward drivers who are consistenly providing services, while reducing their total number of urban drivers to create a total rides to total drivers ratio in urban centers that is similar to that of suburban and rural communities.
